What to Build?

In this project, you will build your own lightweight utility-first CSS engine using JavaScript.

Instead of writing traditional CSS, users will write class names following a pattern like chai-* (for example: chai-p-2, chai-bg-red, chai-text-center). Your script will scan the DOM, read these class names, convert them into corresponding inline styles, and apply them dynamically.

For example:

    chai-p-2 → padding: 2px

    chai-bg-red → background-color: red

Your system should:

    Traverse the DOM after page load

    Identify all classes starting with chai-

    Parse the class names and extract styling values

    Apply inline styles using JavaScript

    Remove or ignore the original chai-* classes

You are expected to support multiple commonly used utilities such as:

    Spacing (padding, margin)

    Colors (background, text)

    Typography (font size, alignment)

    Borders and radius

    Basic layout utilities

This project focuses on DOM manipulation, pattern parsing, and building a reusable client-side library that mimics the behavior of utility-first CSS frameworks.
